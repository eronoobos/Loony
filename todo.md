- scale peak noise with crater size
- add geothermals
- complex shape: rim terracing
- add world save/load
- attribute interactions: the ejecta & breccia should be made of underlying material, so if an impact happens in the middle of a giant melt for instance, it doesn't weirdly make itself lighter than its surroundings. that would require an attribute map stored in memory like the height map.
- change distance squared to distance?
- still slightly confused about how overlapping crater interactions should resolve
- optional base perlin noise
- switch gadget to widget? not sure what's worse, indirect access to map, or to files
