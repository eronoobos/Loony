- complex shape:
	- rim terracing (use a by-distance 1D noise?)
- attributes: breccia, crater melt, central peak, ejecta blanket
- age craters by flattening their contours and adding a bit of perlin noise
- speed up heightpixel
	- replace gaussian with smoothstep?
- add mirroring (for every meteor added another is added in symmetry on the other side of the map). option between rotational or reflectional symmetry. mirror meteors have slightly modified properties, to make the end map look less boring.
- add world save / load
- switch gadget to widget? not sure what's worse, indirect access to map, or to files
